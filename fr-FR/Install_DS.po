"This program will set up the 389 Directory and Administration Servers.\n"

"It is recommended that you have \"root\" privilege to set up the software.\n"
"Tips for using this program:\n"
"  - Press \"Enter\" to choose the default and go to the next screen\n"
"  - Type \"Control-B\" then \"Enter\" to go back to the previous screen\n"
"  - Type \"Control-C\" to cancel the setup program\n"

"Choose a setup type:\n"
"\n"
"   1. Express\n"
"       Allows you to quickly set up the servers using the most\n"
"       common options and pre-defined defaults. Useful for quick\n"
"       evaluation of the products.\n"
"\n"
"   2. Typical\n"
"       Allows you to specify common defaults and options.\n"
"\n"
"   3. Custom\n"
"       Allows you to specify more advanced options. This is\n"

"To accept the default shown in brackets, press the Enter key.\n"

"Warning: This step may take a few minutes if your DNS servers\n"

"Computer name [marmolada.oats.inaf.it]:\n"

"==============================================================================\n"
"The servers must run as a specific user in a specific group.\n"
"It is strongly recommended that this user should have no privileges\n"
"on the computer (i.e. a non-root user).  The setup procedure\n"
"will give this user/group some permissions in specific paths/files\n"
"to perform server-specific operations.\n"

"Server information is stored in the configuration directory server.\n"
"This information is used by the console and administration server to\n"
"configure and manage your servers.  If you have already set up a\n"
"configuration directory server, you should register any servers you\n"
"set up or create with the configuration server.  To do so, the\n"
"following information about the configuration server is required: the\n"
"fully qualified host name of the form\n"
"&lt;hostname&gt;.&lt;domainname&gt;(e.g. hostname.example.com), the port number\n"
"(default 389), the suffix, the DN and password of a user having\n"
"permission to write the configuration information, usually the\n"
"configuration directory administrator, and if you are using security\n"
"(TLS/SSL).  If you are using TLS/SSL, specify the TLS/SSL (LDAPS) port\n"
"number (default 636) instead of the regular LDAP port number, and\n"
"provide the CA certificate (in PEM/ASCII format).\n"
"\n"
"If you do not yet have a configuration directory server, enter 'No' to\n"
"be prompted to set up one.\n"
"\n"
"Do you want to register this software with an existing\n"
"configuration directory server? [no]:\n"
"\n"
"==============================================================================\n"
"Please enter the administrator ID for the configuration directory\n"

"will also be prompted for the password.\n"

"The information stored in the configuration directory server can be\n"
"separated into different Administration Domains.  If you are managing\n"
"multiple software releases at the same time, or managing information\n"
"about multiple domains, you may use the Administration Domain to keep\n"
"them separate.\n"
"\n"
"If you are not using administrative domains, press Enter to select the\n"
"default.  Otherwise, enter some descriptive, unique name for the\n"
"administration domain, such as the name of the organization\n"
"responsible for managing the domain.\n"

"The standard directory server network port number is 389.  However, if\n"
"you are not logged as the superuser, or port 389 is in use, the\n"
"default value will be a random unused port number greater than 1024.\n"
"If you want to use port 389, make sure that you are logged in as the\n"
"superuser, that port 389 is not in use.\n"
"\n"
"Directory server network port [389]:\n"
"\n"
"==============================================================================\n"
"Each instance of a directory server requires a unique identifier.\n"
"This identifier is used to name the various\n"
"instance specific files and directories in the file system,\n"
"as well as for other uses as a server instance identifier.\n"
"\n"
"Directory server identifier [marmolada]: gms-ds\n"
"\n"
"==============================================================================\n"
"The suffix is the root of your directory tree.  The suffix must be a valid DN.\n"
"It is recommended that you use the dc=domaincomponent suffix convention.\n"
"For example, if your domain is example.com,\n"
"you should use dc=example,dc=com for your suffix.\n"
"Setup will create this initial suffix for you,\n"
"but you may have more than one suffix.\n"
"Use the directory server utilities to create additional suffixes.\n"
"\n"
"Suffix [dc=oats, dc=inaf, dc=it]: dc=iinaf, dc=it\n"
"\n"
"==============================================================================\n"
"==============================================================================\n"
"Certain directory server operations require an administrative user.\n"
"This user is referred to as the Directory Manager and typically has a\n"
"bind Distinguished Name (DN) of cn=Directory Manager.\n"
"You will also be prompted for the password for this user.  The password must\n"
"be at least 8 characters long, and contain no spaces.\n"
"Press Control-B or type the word \"back\", then Enter to back up and start over.\n"

"servers since it listens to a different port and access to it is\n"
"restricted.\n"
"\n"
"Pick a port number between 1024 and 65535 to run your Administration\n"
